# Stock-Prediction-by-LSTM

### Work I did in my internship at Sabertooth Technologies (https://sabertoothtech.in).

* Cleaned the data of stock prices fetched by Ticker, as it is the first step towards building any successful neural model.

* Built an LSTM (Neural Model) to predict how a company's stock price will change the next day using many factors.

* Used different platforms (such as Tensorboard) to better understand a model's growth and better visualisation of the results.

### The things which I comprehend are: 
* ***The importance of understanding business objectives.***

* ***Importance of the correct input of a dataset.***

* ***Convert a raw form data into the input desired by the neural model.*** 

* ***Importance of preprocessing on the dataset.***

* ***Ways to fine-tune hyperparameters.***

* ***Methods to efficiently analyze the performance of the model using various platforms followed by employing suitable approaches to overcome the defect.***

### The Output of Neural Model and Our efforts after 3 months:-

#### Many ups and downs of prices were predicted correctly before happening! Can't reveal much.. It is company's asset now.
